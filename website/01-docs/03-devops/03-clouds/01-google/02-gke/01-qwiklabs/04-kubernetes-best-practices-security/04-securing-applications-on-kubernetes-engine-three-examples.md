# [GSP482] Securing Applications on Kubernetes Engine - Three Examples

### Overview

In this lab you will learn how Kubernetes Engine security features can be used to grant varying levels of privilege to applications based on their particular requirements.

When configuring security, applications should be granted the smallest set of privileges that still allows them to operate correctly. When applications have more privileges than they need, they are more dangerous when compromised. In a Kubernetes cluster, these privileges can be grouped into the following broad levels:

- Host access: describes what permissions an application has on it's host node, outside of its container. This is controlled via Pod and Container security contexts, as well as app armor profiles.
- Network access: describes what other resources or workloads an application can access via the network. This is controlled with NetworkPolicies.
- Kubernetes API access: describes which API calls an application is allowed to make against. API access is controlled using the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model via Role and RoleBinding definitions.

<br/>

### Architecture

The lab uses three applications to illustrate the scenarios described above:

Hardened Web Server (nginx)
Creates an nginx deployment whose pods have their host-level access restricted by an AppArmor profile and whose network connectivity is restricted by a NetworkPolicy.

System Daemonset (AppArmor Loader)
Creates a daemonset responsible for loading (installing) the AppArmor profile applied to the nginx pods on each node. Loading profiles requires more privileges than can be provided via Capabilities, so it's containers are given full privileges via their SecurityContexts.

Simplified Kubernetes Controller (Pod Labeler)
The pod-labeler deployment creates a single pod that watches all other pods in the default namespace and periodically labels them. This requires access to the Kubernetes API server, which is configured via RBAC using a ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleMapping.

### [Install Terraform](//gitops.ru/terraform/setup//)

<br>

### Lab setup

    $ gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
    $ gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

    $ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-security-scenarios-demo

    $ cd gke-security-scenarios-demo

    $ make setup-project
    $ make create

<br/>

    $ gcloud compute instances list

<br/>

    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-64c7c7666-99mld   0/1     Blocked   0          5s
    nginx-64c7c7666-rpxg9   0/1     Blocked   0          6s
    nginx-64c7c7666-tg585   0/1     Blocked   0          6s

<br/>

You should see that while the pods have been created, they're in a Blocked state. The nginx pods are blocked because the manifest includes an AppArmor profile that doesn't exist on the nodes:

    $ kubectl describe pod -l app=nginx

<br/>

### Set up AppArmor-loader

In order to resolve this, the relevant AppArmor profile must be loaded. Because you don't know on which nodes the nginx pods will be allocated, you must deploy the AppArmor profile to all nodes. The way you'll deploy this, ensuring all nodes are covered, is via a daemonset https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#what-is-a-daemonset.

The included apparmor-loader.yaml is a highly privileged manifest, as it needs to write a file onto each node. The contents of that file are in the configmap included in the same.

<br/>

    $ kubectl apply -f manifests/apparmor-loader.yaml

    $ cat manifests/apparmor-loader.yaml
